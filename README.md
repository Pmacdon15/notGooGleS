Fake google login that saves info entered to the directory the exe is stored in.
I incorporated a big large knot Google in the design there was no nefarious purposes behind creating this I just wanted to understand file management better. Eventually the project evolved and it is now set up in such a way where it can send the information that it gets from the fake login to a http server.
